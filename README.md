# AngularJs-MVC
AngularJS, formerly Angular 1.X and now sometimes referred to as ng1, is a full fledged language to itself. This repository contains a simple AngularJS application starter template showcasing components as the main building block (not controllers). It uses lite-server to serve the site (which is just a thin layer for browsersync). Launchable in vscode, which makes it quick to get up.

# Frameworks

1. angular components
2. [ui-router](https://ui-router.github.io/ng1/tutorial/helloworld)
3. multi-view components
4. one way data binding
5. [Angular Spinners](https://github.com/chevtek/angular-spinners/tree/gh-pages)

# Steps for installation
1. Install Node.JS via [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows))
2. NPM should be installed with your Nodejs and is a very useful package manager
3. open a command prompt to this directory 
4. npm install
5. npm run start
6. (optional) If using vscode, you can just simply "launch" after you run npm install

# Component Tutorials

At the end of the day, components should be used for everything. Controllers can be optional. I tend to add a controller to my component "just in case" but that's personal preference.
